## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our AI Chatbot seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Send a detailed report

Please email security reports to: [security@example.com] or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Within 24 hours**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report
- **Within 1 week**: We'll provide an initial assessment
- **Within 2 weeks**: We'll develop and test a fix
- **Within 1 month**: We'll release a patch and public disclosure

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits of npm packages
- **Docker Security**: Non-root user, minimal base image

### CI/CD Security

- **Secret Management**: GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated security audits in CI pipeline
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for transparency

### Infrastructure Security

- **TLS/SSL**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring
- **Updates**: Regular security updates and patches

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

3. **Use secure dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities
4. **Follow coding standards**: Security-focused code review
5. **Update dependencies**: Keep packages up to date

## Security Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Code security scanning
- **Dependency Audit**: npm audit and Snyk scanning  
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability assessment
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate and contain the threat
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and patches
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users
